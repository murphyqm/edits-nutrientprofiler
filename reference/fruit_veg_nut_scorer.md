# Fruit, Vegetable and nut scorer

The scoring logic for the percentage of fruit, vegetables and nuts in a
product is different to other scorers. Therefore, we can't use the
generic scoring function and have to write a specific one here.

## Usage

``` r
fruit_veg_nut_scorer(value)
```

## Arguments

- value:

  a numeric value of the percentage of fruit, nuts and vegetables

## Value

a numeric score value
